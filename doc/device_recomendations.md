## Screen 
FScruiser has been designed to work on both phones and tablets. However we find medium sized devices (6 - 8 inches) seem to offer the best compromise between the amount of information they can display while not being too bulky.
Screen size requirements may differ from forest to forest. Areas that typically cruise more populations may prefer a larger screen to display more tally buttons, however areas with only a few populations may be fine with a phone. 

## Other Features
### Active Pen
Some devices Samsung devices come with a pen. Known as the S Pen, these pens work different from how other third "pens". Also known as an active pen, these pens interact with the device without using touch. When the S pen is used FScruiser is able to differentiate between touch and the pen, allowing you to enable a pen only mode.

### Rugged Devices
Many consumer devices can be rugged using a case. Cases can offer good drop protection and some come with straps to make they easy to carry in hand, however cases typically don't offer great protection against water or dust. When cases do offer water or dust protection their protective ability can be negated when improperly used.
If your devices need to be protected against water it is best to look for a device that are water resistant rather than relying on a case to protect your device.

### Extra Battery Capacity
Some devices offer extended battery capacity. These devices also tend to be larger and heavier. The heavier a device is the more susceptible it is to damage when being dropped. Many devices will compensate for this fact by adding additional bulk to make them rugged. 

When determining your batter requirements, consider the use of external battery packs.
